            "- 2 pounds ground beef\n",
            "- 1 large onion, chopped\n",
            "- 1 small head cabbage, chopped\n",

            "- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
            "- 2 teaspoons salt\n",
            "- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n",
            "Instructions:\n",
            "1. This unstuffed cabbage roll dish is a cheap, quick, and easy weeknight dinner you don't want to miss. If you're looking for a simple and hearty casserole that's just as good the next day, you're going to want to add this one to your recipe box.\n",
            "2. An unstuffed cabbage roll is basically a deconstructed version of a regular casserole. All the traditional cabbage roll ingredients (cabbage, ground beef, tomatoes, other veggies, and spices and seasonings) are cooked together — so you don't have to worry about pre-cooking and rolling the cabbage.\n",
            "3. Here's what you'll need to make this unstuffed cabbage roll recipe:\n",
            "4. BeefThis unstuffed cabbage roll recipe calls for two pounds of ground beef, but you could use ground turkey or chicken if you're so inclined.\n",
            "5. OnionA diced white or yellow onion is cooked with the beef, adding bold flavor.\n",
            "6. CabbageYou'll need one head of cabbage, cleaned and roughly chopped.\n",
            "7. Canned TomatoesTraditional cabbage rolls are topped with a savory tomato-based sauce. To replicate this, use two cans of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce.\n",
            "8. WaterA half cup of water is enough extra liquid for this recipe. For more flavor, substitute beef broth.\n",
            "9. SeasoningsThis unstuffed cabbage roll recipe is simply seasoned with garlic, salt, and ground black pepper.\n",
            "10. Rice (Optional)Though this unstuffed cabbage roll is delicious on its own, you can serve it over white or brown rice to bulk it up a bit.\n",
            "11. Allow the leftover unstuffed cabbage roll to cool, then transfer it to an airtight storage container. Keep it in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave, on the stove, or in the oven.\n",
            "12. Yes, you can freeze this unstuffed cabbage roll. Allow the dish to cool, then transfer it to a shallow freezer-safe storage container. Freeze the unstuffed cabbage roll for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat on the stove.\n",
            "13. \"My husband and I loved this,\" says Vicky. \"We ate it like a stew. A bowl for each of us, with a piece of cornbread, and we were set. This is definitely going in my recipe box.\"\n",
            "14. \"Great recipe,\" raves Big Dave. \"This is one of those versatile, one-pot dishes that is easily personalized.\n",
            "15. \"It was simple and quick and yummy,\" according to Angie. \"When I make it again, I might use turkey instead of ground beef and maybe add some red pepper flakes for some heat, but really, the recipe is perfect as is.\n",
            "16. Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n",
            "17. Gather all ingredients.\n",
            "18. Heat a Dutch oven or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot Dutch oven until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.\n",
            "19. Add cabbage, tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, garlic, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Cover Dutch oven, reduce heat, and simmer until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes.\n",
            "20. Serve hot and enjoy!\n",
